This project showcases a robust, scalable, and efficient data pipeline designed for Airbnb data using the power of AWS and GCP. The pipeline extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data from multiple sources, ensuring high performance and reliability. It leverages AWS services like S3, Lambda, and Redshift for storage and processing, while utilising GCP's BigQuery and Dataflow for advanced analytics and real-time data processing.
